// java doesnt truly have 2x2 grid array
// rather java does array of array: char[][] means array of array of characters (read from right to left: (char[])[]) e.g. int [] means array of integers

//board [y] [x + offset]... line is translation of matrix




 
//FOR THE GRID
//check location, give each of the 8 neighbouring positions an algebraic expression that can be looped through a list, for varying central positions
//check bounds
//check star

//try to minimise if statements to make program more efficient (especially when already within a loop)
//but should have enough ifs to make sure the code is clear to the reader
